            <h2>Battle of Adwa</h2>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> March 1, 1896</p>
            <p>The Battle of Adwa was a decisive military victory by Ethiopian forces led by Emperor Menelik II and Empress Taytu Betul against the Italian army. It was the culmination of Italy’s attempt to colonize Ethiopia under the Treaty of Wuchale. This victory shocked Europe, preserved Ethiopian sovereignty, and inspired anti-colonial movements across Africa and the world.</p>

            <h2>Battle of Dogali</h2>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> January 26, 1887</p>
            <p>Fought between Ethiopian forces led by Ras Alula and Italian colonial troops, the Battle of Dogali occurred near Massawa (now in Eritrea). The Italians were ambushed and nearly annihilated. Though Italy later retaliated, Dogali became a symbol of Ethiopian resistance and military capability during the Scramble for Africa.</p>

            <h2>Zemene Mesafint</h2>
            <p><strong>Period:</strong> 1769–1855</p>
            <p>This was an era of decentralization and internal conflict where real power was held by regional lords while emperors served as figureheads. The country was fragmented politically and militarily. The era ended with the rise of Emperor Tewodros II, who began the process of reunifying and modernizing Ethiopia.</p>

            <h2>Italian Occupation</h2>
            <p><strong>Period:</strong> 1936–1941</p>
            <p>Following a brutal invasion and use of chemical warfare, Fascist Italy occupied Ethiopia, annexing it into Italian East Africa. Emperor Haile Selassie fled into exile and made a historic appeal to the League of Nations. The Ethiopian resistance (Arbegnoch) continued to fight until Allied forces and Ethiopian patriots liberated the country in 1941.</p>

            <img src="/images/unflag.jpg" alt="Ethiopia Joins the UN">
            <h2>Founding Member of the United Nations</h2>
            <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1945</p>
            <p>As one of only four independent African nations at the time, Ethiopia was a founding member of the United Nations. Haile Selassie’s advocacy for collective security and pan-African cooperation helped shape early discussions on decolonization and self-determination. Ethiopia also later hosted the African Union’s predecessor, the OAU, in Addis Ababa.</p>

            <h2>Fall of the Derg Regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1991</p>
            <p>The Derg, a Marxist-Leninist military regime, came to power in 1974 after overthrowing Emperor Haile Selassie. It ruled with repression, forced collectivization, and a bloody civil war. In 1991, after 17 years of conflict and famine, the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) captured Addis Ababa, ending the dictatorship and ushering in a new federal republic.</p>
